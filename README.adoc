`CloudFoundryCertificateTruster` will download certificates
and add them to the JVM truststore at the earliest possible time.

== Dependencies

Include the dependency in your Spring Boot project to activate the certificate truster.(should clone to local and build to local maven respository first)

=== Maven

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>cloudfoundry-certificate-truster</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.1.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Gradle

[source,groovy]
----
compile("io.pivotal.spring.cloud:cloudfoundry-certificate-truster:1.0.1.RELEASE")
----

== Usage

Certificates can be specified by either or both of the following environment variables:

----
CF_TARGET=https://api.my-cf-domain.com
----

This will cause `CloudFoundryCertificateTruster` to download the certificate at api.my-cf-domain.com:443 and add
it to the JVM's truststore.

----
TRUST_CERTS=api.foo.com,api.bar.com:8443
----

This will cause `CloudFoundryCertificateTruster` to download the certificates at api.foo.com:443 and api.bar.com:8443 and add them to the JVM's truststore. You can specify one or more comma separated hostnames, optionally with a port.

NOTE: The timeout for certificate download is 5 seconds. If any errors occur, they are printed to System.err.
